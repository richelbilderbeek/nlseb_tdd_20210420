# Spend less time coding using test-driven development

NLSEB PhD and Postdoc Day workshop: spend less time coding using Test-Driven Development

# Content

On average, 80% of the time we spend debugging.
Test-driven development is a technique used by
professional software developers to reduce this time,
by writing tests before the actual code.
Although this initially feels 'inside-out', it results
in correct code quicker.

In this hands-on workshop, we'll write tests for simple functions
to practice this way of developing.

It is assumed you can read basic R code and that you
have an R environment (e.g. R Studio) installed.
